# Digital Psychological Intervention System

## Problem Statement

### Context
Mental health issues among college students have significantly increased in recent years, including anxiety, depression, burnout, sleep disorders, academic stress, and social isolation. However, there is a major gap in the availability, accessibility, and stigma-free delivery of mental health support in most higher education institutions, especially in rural and semi-urban colleges.

### Problems Faced
- Absence of a structured, scalable, and stigma-free psychological intervention system.  
- Lack of early detection and preventive mental health tools.  
- Under-utilization of college counselling centres due to fear of judgment or lack of awareness.  
- No centralized mental health monitoring or data-driven policy framework within institutions.  

---

## Our Solution
We propose a **web-based application** that addresses these challenges through:

- **Regional cultural context and language integration**  
- **Institution-specific customization** for policies and resources  
- **Offline support mapping**, such as linking with college counsellors and helplines  
- **Real-time analytics for administrators** to track anonymous trends and plan interventions  

Hence, a tailored **open-source solution** is needed to fill this critical gap in student psychological support.
